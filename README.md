# Waves

This a simulation code to sample configurations of a vapor--liquid like 
interface, the energetics of which are governed by a capillary-wave hamiltonian:

H[h(x,y)] = \int_{x,y} \left[ \frac{\gamma}{2} | \nabla h(x,y) |^{2} \right]

where \gamma is the surface tension of water. Further details of this interface model are 
presented in the Supporting Information section of 
[Patel el al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 108, 17678-17683 (2011)] 
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1110703108)
The code also allows for addition external potentials to the hamiltonian to model the 
liquid-vapor like interface near hydrophobic surfaces.


This README is currently incomplete. More information on how to use the code
and examples will be added shortly.
