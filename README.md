# Waves

This a simulation code to sample configurations of a vapor--liquid like 
interface, the energetics of which are governed by a capillary-wave hamiltonian.
The code also allows for addition external potentials to the hamiltonian.

This README is currently incomplete. More information on how to use the code
and examples will be added shortly.
